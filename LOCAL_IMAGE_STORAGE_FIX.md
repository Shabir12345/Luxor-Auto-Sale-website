# 📸 Local Image Storage Fix - Luxor Auto Sale

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**
- Images showing as icons instead of actual photos
- Images not appearing on public website
- Placeholder system not working properly

### **Solution Applied:**
- **Local file storage:** Images now save to `public/uploads/` directory
- **Real image display:** Actual uploaded images show up
- **Public access:** Images accessible via `/uploads/filename.jpg`

---

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### **Upload Process:**
1. **User uploads image** → File sent to `/api/admin/upload`
2. **File saved locally** → Stored in `public/uploads/` directory
3. **URL generated** → `/uploads/filename.jpg`
4. **Database record** → Photo record created with URL
5. **Display** → Real image shows in admin and public site

### **File Structure:**
```
public/
  └── uploads/
      ├── vehicle-1234567890-image1.jpg
      ├── vehicle-1234567891-image2.jpg
      └── .gitkeep (ensures directory exists)
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### **1. Upload New Images:**
```
1. Go to: /admin/vehicles
2. Click "Photos" on any vehicle
3. Upload 2-3 images
4. You should see ACTUAL images (not icons)
```

### **2. Set Primary Photo:**
```
1. Click "Set Primary" on any image
2. That image becomes the main photo
3. Primary badge appears on selected image
```

### **3. Check Public Website:**
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Scroll to "Featured Vehicles" section
3. You should see real images (not placeholders)

- **Access:** `http://localhost:3000/uploads/filename.jpg`

### **Git Tracking:**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
