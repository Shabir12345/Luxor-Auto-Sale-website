# ðŸ”§ Vehicle Form Submission Fix

## Problem
When trying to add a vehicle, you got:
- **Frontend:** "Network error. Please try again."
- **Console:** `POST /api/admin/vehicles 500 (Internal Server Error)`

## Root Cause
The form was sending empty strings (`""`) for optional fields like:
- `bodyType: ""`
- `drivetrain: ""`
- `fuelType: ""`
- `transmission: ""`

But Zod validation expected these to be either:
- A valid enum value (e.g., `"SEDAN"`, `"FWD"`)
- `undefined` (not included in the request)

## Solution âœ…

### Updated `VehicleForm.tsx`
Changed the form submission to only include fields that have actual values:

```typescript
// Before: sent all fields (including empty strings)
const data = { ...formData, ... }

// After: only send fields with values
const data = { vin, year, make, model, ... }; // required fields
if (formData.bodyType) data.bodyType = formData.bodyType; // optional
```

### Added Logging in `route.ts`
Added console logs to help debug:
- Logs the received data
- Logs validation errors

## Testing

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5)
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/vehicles/new
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Required fields:** VIN, Year, Make, Model, Title, Price, Mileage
   - **Optional fields:** Leave blank or fill them
4. Click "Create Vehicle"
5. **Expected:** Vehicle should be created successfully!

## What Changed
- âœ… `src/components/VehicleForm.tsx` - Fixed data submission
- âœ… `src/app/api/admin/vehicles/route.ts` - Added debug logging

---

**Status:** Ready to test! Just refresh your browser and try adding a vehicle again.
