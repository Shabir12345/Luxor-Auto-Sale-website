# How to Get R2 Public URL

## üéØ R2_PUBLIC_URL is OPTIONAL

You don't necessarily need to set `R2_PUBLIC_URL`. The app will generate URLs automatically.

## üìç Three Ways to Set Up Public Access

### Option 1: Use Custom Domain (Recommended)

If you set up a custom domain for your R2 bucket:

1. **In Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Go to R2 ‚Üí Your Bucket
   - Click "Settings"
   - Under "Public Access", if you have a custom domain, it looks like:
     ```
     https://images.yourdomain.com
     ```

2. **Set in Vercel**:
   ```
   R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://images.yourdomain.com
   ```

### Option 2: Use Cloudflare R2.dev Domain

Cloudflare provides default public domains:

1. **In Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Go to R2 ‚Üí Your Bucket
   - Click "Settings"
   - Look for "Public URL" or "Public Bucket" setting
   - The URL format is usually:
     ```
     https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
     ```

2. **To Enable Public Access**:
   - In bucket settings, enable "Public Access"
   - Cloudflare will give you a public URL like: `https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev`
   - Make sure your bucket is set to public!

3. **Set in Vercel**:
   ```
   R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev
   ```

### Option 3: Don't Set It (Let App Generate URLs)

If you don't set `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, the app will try to construct URLs automatically.

**No action needed** - just leave `R2_PUBLIC_URL` empty in Vercel.
