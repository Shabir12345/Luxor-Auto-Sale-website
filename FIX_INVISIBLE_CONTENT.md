# 🔧 Fixed: Invisible Content Issue

## Problem
All sections were built correctly, but text and images were invisible (only background visible).

## Root Cause
The `.reveal` class in `globals.css` had `opacity: 0` by default, waiting for JavaScript to add the `.visible` class to make content appear. In the React/Next.js environment, this caused content to remain invisible.

## Solution
Changed the `.reveal` class to show content by default:

```css
/* BEFORE (content hidden by default) */
.reveal {
  opacity: 0;  /* ❌ Content invisible */
  transform: translateY(30px);
}

/* AFTER (content visible by default) */
.reveal {
  opacity: 1;  /* ✅ Content visible */
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

## What Was Fixed
✅ All section content now visible
✅ Text displays properly
✅ Images load and display
✅ Forms are visible
✅ All sections render correctly

## How to Test
1. **Refresh your browser** with `Ctrl+F5` (hard refresh)
2. **Scroll through all sections**:
   - ✅ Hero Section - "Drive Confidently."
   - ✅ Featured Vehicles
   - ✅ Why Choose Us
   - ✅ Testimonials
   - ✅ Inventory
   - ✅ Financing Form
   - ✅ Sell/Trade Form
   - ✅ About Section (with image and map)
   - ✅ Contact Form
   - ✅ Footer

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All content should now be visible!

If you still see issues:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)
